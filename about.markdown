Hello everyone, my name is Nicholas and I'm a 3rd year computer engineer at Iowa State university.
My primary focus is in cyber security and I am planning on pursuing a masters degree in cyber security
at Iowa State once I complete my under graduate degree. I plan on specialising in Red Teaming and
penetration testing. 

Feel free to contact me at my school email with any questions about my projects: nk3@iastate[.]edu
