### About Me

I am a security researcher and developer focused on offensive security based in the US
with a focus on Reverse Engineering, Vulnerability research, and C development.
I graduated with my masters degree in cyber security engineering and bachelor’s
of computer engineering in 2023. I am a fan of understanding how computer systems 
work on a low level and how these systems can be coxed into behnaving in unintended
and interesting ways. 


### What is this

Over the years I've benefited massively from other researchers and developers sharing
their experiences and techniques freely. This is my attempt to collect my thoughts for
myself and share what I can to others to pay it forward. That said no promises are being
made about the frequency of posts, consistency of topic, or accuracy. I will do my 
best to distinguish between what I have done, what I think is the case, and what others
have claimed (with citations to their work).

Some areas of interest that should show up are:
 - C development
 - Developing with restricted access to tools
 - Vulnerability Research
 - Reverse Engineering
