I"0<p>This is a paper that I wrote for my CPR E 530 class at Iowa state. We were supposed to look into a network and try and find vulnerbilities that the network creates. I hope you enjoy it. Iâ€™m still trying to figure out how to use this web hosting system so the pictures may not be up for a while.</p>
