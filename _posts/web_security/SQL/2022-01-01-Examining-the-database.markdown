Different database types have different syntax and standard tables so it is often a good idea to know what type of database you are attacking.

This can be done with [[OSINT]] however it is also possible to do this by preforming database type and version attacks. Most (if not all) databases have a table that you can select from to get version information

![[Quiries#Database type and version request]]

The useful columns in the all table database is
table_name
column_name
