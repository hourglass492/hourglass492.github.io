I think that general education is an extremely under valued part of engineering education. While I did not take my gen ed classes at Iowa State, my studies in the history of revolutions and how contemporary politics got where it is are extraordinarily important in how I look at engineering problems.

I feel like when we as engineers approach problems we ignore the vast majority of non technical requirements like social buy in and we don't look at whether or not a project actually address a real social need or if it is some form of solution ism. Without these general education classes, I would not have the broader perspective needed to take in other peoples views.

While I have not directly faced these problems yet, because the social consequences of school projects are often negligible, they are rampant in the cyber security profession. There are massive projects that's social problems and considerations dwarf the technical problems. Everything from the NSA's PRISM project developed after 9/11 to the more recent Project Raven which happened in the UAE. Both of these projects almost certainly stripped main people unknowingly of their privacy and data protection rights and made the world a worse off place.

These moral failings show a clear lack of understanding of the historical context of the cyber security profession, that these classes focused on history and other classes that I have taken on Moral theory could have provided.
